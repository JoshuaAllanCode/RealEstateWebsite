	<h2>1% listing fee</h2>
		<p>I charge a flat 1% rate. full service sales for discount prices.  Other firms have started listing at 1%, but you have very limited access to your licensed real estate broker.  They just pass you down the production line. I am with you every step of the way.</p>
	<div>purchasing</div>
